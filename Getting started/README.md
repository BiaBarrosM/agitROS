# Getting started

*In which we install ROS, introduce some basic ROS concepts, and interact with a working ROS system.*

Before jumping into the details of how to write software that uses ROS, it will be valuable to get ROS up and running and to understand a few of the basic ideas that ROS uses. This chapter lays that groundwork. After a quick discussion of how to install ROS and configure your user account to use it, weâ€™ll have a look at a working ROS system (specifically, an instance of the `turtlesim` simulator) and learn how to interact with that system using some command line tools.
